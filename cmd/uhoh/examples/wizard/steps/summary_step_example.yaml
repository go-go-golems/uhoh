      Thank you for exploring the Summary Step Demo!

      In a real application, after reviewing the summary,
      the wizard might save the data to a database, create a 
      user account, or perform other finalization actions.

      The summary step is an important part of providing a 
      good user experience by letting users verify their 
      information before it's processed.
