      # Using Info Steps

      Info steps are used to display information to users, such as:

      * Welcome messages and introductions
      * Instructions and help text
      * Summary information
      * Completion messages

      They support **markdown** formatting for rich text display.

      The content field contains the main body of text to display,
      while the description field can provide a shorter summary.

  - id: info_example_2
    type: info
    title: Another Example
    content: |
      This is another info step without a description.

      Info steps don't modify the wizard state, they just
      display information to the user.

      Press Next to continue.
