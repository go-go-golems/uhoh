      This wizard demonstrates how action steps work.

      Action steps perform background operations without requiring
      direct user input. They're useful for:

      * API calls
      * Database operations
      * File system operations
      * Calculations and data processing

      When using action steps in real applications, you'll need to register
      callback functions that the action steps can call.

      Click Next to see an action step in operation.

      In a real application, the action steps would have:

      1. Validated and saved your user information
      2. Generated a customized report

      This example demonstrates how action steps can perform
      operations in the background and store their results in
      the wizard state for use by subsequent steps.
