      # Enhanced Navigation Demo

      This wizard demonstrates the advanced navigation features, including:

      * Rich decision options with labels and values
      * Direct navigation using next_step
      * Navigation mapping with next_step_map
      * Navigation callbacks

      Click Next to see these navigation options in action.

  - id: first_choice
    type: decision
    title: Navigation Method
    description: How would you like to navigate?
    target_key: navigation_method
    options:
      - value: "direct"
        label: "Direct Navigation (next_step)"
      - value: "conditional"
        label: "Conditional Navigation (next_step_map)"
      - value: "callback"
        label: "Callback Navigation (skip for now)"
    next_step_map:
      "direct": direct_nav_example
      "conditional": conditional_nav_example
      "callback": callback_nav_example

  - id: direct_nav_example
    type: info
    title: Direct Navigation
    content: |
      # Direct Navigation

      This step demonstrates direct navigation using the `next_step` field.

      When you click Next, you'll be taken directly to the "Conclusion" step,
      skipping other steps that would normally come next in sequence.
    next_step: conclusion

  - id: conditional_nav_example
    type: decision
    title: Conditional Navigation
    description: Choose your path
    target_key: path_choice
    options:
      - value: "path_a"
        label: "Path A"
      - value: "path_b"
        label: "Path B"
    next_step_map:
      "path_a": path_a
      "path_b": path_b

  - id: path_a
    type: info
    title: Path A
    content: |
      # You Chose Path A

      This step was reached through conditional navigation.

      From here, you'll proceed to the conclusion.
    next_step: conclusion

  - id: path_b
    type: info
    title: Path B
    content: |
      # You Chose Path B

      This step was reached through conditional navigation.

      From here, you'll proceed to the conclusion.
    next_step: conclusion

  - id: callback_nav_example
    type: info
    title: Callback Navigation
    content: |
      # Callback Navigation

      This step would normally use a callback to dynamically determine
      the next step based on complex logic or external data.

      In a real implementation, you would register a navigation callback
      that could evaluate the state and return the ID of the next step.

      For this example, we'll proceed to the conclusion.
    next_step: conclusion

  - id: skipped_step
    type: info
    title: Skipped Step
    content: |
      # This Step Should Be Skipped

      If you're seeing this step, something went wrong with the navigation.
      All paths should bypass this step and go directly to the conclusion.

  - id: conclusion
    type: info
    title: Navigation Complete

      # Navigation Demo Complete

      Congratulations! You've successfully completed the navigation demo.

      This example has demonstrated:

      * Rich decision options with separate values and labels
      * Direct navigation using `next_step`
      * Conditional navigation using `next_step_map`
      * The concept of navigation callbacks

      These navigation features allow you to create complex, branching
      wizard flows that guide users based on their choices and data.
